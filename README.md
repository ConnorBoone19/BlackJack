# BlackJack
I made a blackjack game to learn OOP in python. if you run the main.py file it will allow you to run the game. 
I have increased my skills as i went so the progression and efficency of code has increased as i went along.
the player, card, dealer files were first copied from a online tutorial, but once my understanding of class and class structure continued I started modifying those files. So I would say they are loosly related to the original material. 
If you have any suggestions or feedback please feel free to message me!
