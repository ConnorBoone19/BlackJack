# BlackJack

I made a blackjack game to learn OOP in python. if you run the main.py file it will allow you to run the game. 

I have increased my skills as I went so the progression and efficency of code has increased as I went along.

The player, card, dealer files were first copied from a online tutorial, but once my understanding of class and class structure continued I started modifying those files. So I would say they are loosly related to the original material. But the rest of the code was written by me.


If you have any suggestions or feedback please feel free to message me!
